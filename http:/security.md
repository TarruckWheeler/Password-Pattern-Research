# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this research code or identify a real-world system vulnerable to these attacks, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### Do NOT:
- 🚫 Exploit vulnerabilities in production systems
- 🚫 Publicly disclose unpatched vulnerabilities
- 🚫 Use this research for illegal activities
- 🚫 Target individuals without explicit permission

### DO:
- ✅ Report vulnerabilities privately first
- ✅ Provide detailed reproduction steps
- ✅ Allow reasonable time for patches
- ✅ Help make the ecosystem more secure

## 📧 How to Report

### Option 1: GitHub Security Advisory (Preferred)
1. Go to the Security tab in this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Provide detailed information

### Option 2: Encrypted Email
```
Email: security@yourdomain.com
PGP Key: [Download from keyserver]
Fingerprint: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
```

### Option 3: Bug Bounty Platforms
We participate in:
- HackerOne: https://hackerone.com/yourprogram
- Bugcrowd: https://bugcrowd.com/yourprogram

## 📝 What to Include

Please provide:
1. **Vulnerability type** (e.g., timing attack, pattern weakness)
2. **Affected components** (specific files/functions)
3. **Impact assessment** (what can an attacker do?)
4. **Reproduction steps** (detailed walkthrough)
5. **Proof of concept** (code demonstrating the issue)
6. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability confirmation**: Within 7 days
- **Patch development**: Within 30 days
- **Public disclosure**: After 90 days (coordinated)

## 🎁 Recognition

We offer:
- Public acknowledgment (with your permission)
- Bug bounty rewards for critical findings
- Co-authorship on security advisories
- Invitation to our security researcher community

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using this research:

### For Researchers
```python
# Always use test data
test_passwords = generate_test_dataset()  # Never use real passwords

# Implement rate limiting
@rate_limit(calls=10, period=60)  # 10 calls per minute
def analyze_patterns(data):
    pass

# Log security events
logger.security_event("pattern_analysis_started", 
                     user=current_user,
                     dataset_hash=hash(data))
```

### For Developers
```javascript
// Implement constant-time comparisons
const crypto = require('crypto');

function secureCompare(a, b) {
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
        Buffer.from(a),
        Buffer.from(b)
    );
}

// Use proper entropy sources
const password = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
```

## 🚨 Known Vulnerabilities

| ID | Component | Status | Severity |
|----|-----------|--------|----------|
| KV-001 | Demo timing server | Won't fix (intentional) | High |
| KV-002 | Pattern analyzer v1 | Fixed in v2.0 | Medium |

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying any code based on this research:

- [ ] Replace all demo credentials
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Use constant-time algorithms
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Review dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Use hardware security modules for keys
- [ ] Enable multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Regular security audits

## 🔐 Cryptographic Standards

This project uses:
- **Hashing**: SHA-256, Argon2id
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 (min 100,000 iterations)
- **Random Numbers**: OS entropy sources only
